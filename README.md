# Movie Catalog System

## Overview

This system is designed to offer a movie catalog similar to IMDB, allowing users to manage and explore a collection of movies, their cast, and directors. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes to structure the application effectively.

## Features

- **Movie Registration:** Users can add movies to the catalog, specifying attributes such as name, release date, budget, and description.
- **Actor Registration:** Actors can be added to the system with detailed attributes.
- **Director Registration:** Directors can be registered with their specific attributes.
- **Association:** Movies can be associated with their respective actors and directors, creating a comprehensive database of cinema personnel involved in each film.
- **Search Functionality:** The system allows users to search for movies by name, ignoring case sensitivity, to easily find the desired entries.
